# Clarity Engine

**Think once. Build right.**

An AI-powered thinking tool that helps you break down goals, surface hidden assumptions, and create clarity before you create chaos.

## Features

Seven thinking modules, each tackling a different challenge:

- **Prerequisite Mapper** - Break any goal into what must be true first
- **Assumption Register** - Surface hidden beliefs you didn't know you were making
- **Handover Machine** - Extract tacit knowledge before it walks out the door
- **Constraint Ratchet** - Creativity under pressure with timed challenges
- **Collision Engine** - Spark ideas by colliding problems with random domains
- **Fragment Resurrector** - Revive abandoned drafts with AI suggestions
- **Inverse Brief** - Define by exclusion, map the possibility space

## Getting Started

1. Open `clarity-engine-v2.html` in your browser (or visit the hosted version)
2. Go to **Settings** and add your AI API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google)
3. Start with the Prerequisite Mapper - enter your goal
4. Use AI buttons to get intelligent analysis and suggestions
5. Export your work as Markdown, JSON, or generate an AI Summary Report

## AI Providers Supported

- **Anthropic Claude** (claude-sonnet-4-20250514, etc.)
- **OpenAI GPT** (gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo, etc.)
- **Google Gemini** (gemini-1.5-pro, etc.)

Your API keys are stored locally in your browser. We never see them.

## Privacy

- All data stored locally in your browser (localStorage)
- API keys never leave your browser except to call the AI providers directly
- No analytics, no tracking, no server-side storage

## Cost

The tool is **free**. You only pay for the AI API calls you make (~$0.01-0.05 per query depending on provider and model).
